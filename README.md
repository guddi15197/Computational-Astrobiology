# Computational-Astrobiology
Course materials of computational astrobiology taken by Lecturer Andjelka Kovacevic in University of Belgrade as a part of Erasmus Mundus joint master program in Astrophysics and Space Science (2022-2024 in the 2nd semester)
In this repo I have uploaded jupyter notebooks of our course tutorials. Most of the notebooks are taken from certain other colabs or notebooks in which I have made further modifications.
